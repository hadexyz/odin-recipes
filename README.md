# odin-recipes
This is a project on where i make a basic website that displays a list of recipes
with each recipe having it's own page and lists of relevant information.

This shows a basic understanding of a website made on HTML and CSS. Links, images and lists are examples of the elements used here, with a basic CSS styling applied to them.
