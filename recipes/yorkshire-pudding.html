    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Yorkshire pudding is a light, fluffy dish that is usually cooked and served alongside a roast dinner, traditionally made with roast meat—especially roast beef. It comes from Yorkshire, a region in the United Kingdom, and is popular across the island.
        The exact recipe differs from area to area, even from family to family, so the below recipe offers a generic approach to the tasty pudding.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>140 g plain flour</li>
        <li>4 ea. (200 g) eggs</li>
        <li>200 ml milk</li>
        <li>Sunflower oil or meat drippings</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>Thyme (optional)</li>
        <li>Rosemary (optional)</li>
        <li>Mustard powder (optional)</li>
        <li>Sage (optional)</li>
        <li>Red onion (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat the oven to 230°C (210°C convection)</li>
        <li>Fill your yorkshire pudding tin(s) with a thin layer of your choosen oil and place into the oven.</li>
        <li>Sieve flour into a bowl, then beat in eggs until smooth.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the milk in stages, beating as you go until well-mixed.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper. Add optional ingredients as desired.</li>
        <li>Transfer the batter to a pouring jug. For best results, rest the batter in the fridge for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Being swift, but careful, remove the hot tin(s) from the oven, and evenly fill the holes with your batter.</li>
        <li>Place the tin(s) back into the oven, and leave them undisturbed for 20–25 minutes until puffed and golden brown. Opening the oven door can upset the cooking of the Yorkshire puddings—trust the process and watch with the door closed.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately. They can also be cooled and frozen for up to 1 month.</li>
    </ol>
